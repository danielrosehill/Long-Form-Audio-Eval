Hello and welcome to a audio data set consisting of one single episode of a non-existent podcast. Or, I may append this to a podcast that I set up recently regarding my with my thoughts on speech tech and AI in particular. More AI in generative AI, I would say. But in any event, the purpose of this voice recording is actually to create a lengthy voice sample for a quick evaluation of back of the envelope evaluation as they might say for different speech attacks models. And I'm doing this because I thought I had made a great breakthrough in my journey with speech tech and that was succeeding in the elusive task of fine-tuning whisper. Whisper is, and I'm going to just talk, I'm trying to mix up, I'm going to try a few different styles of speaking, I might whisper something at some points as well. And I'll go back to speaking loud in a different part. So I'm going to send really like a crazy person because I'm also going to try to speak at different pitches and cadences in order to really try to put a speech attacks model through its pieces, which is trying to make sense of, is this guy just ramling on and coherently in one long sentence or are these just actually a series of 

step of standalone, standalone, standalone sentences. And how is it going to handle step alone? That's not a word. What happens when you use speech attacks and you use a fake word. And then you're like, wait, that's not actually that word doesn't exist. How does AI handle that? And these and more are all the questions that I'm seeking to answer in this training data. Now, why was it trying to find you to whisper? And what is whisper, as I said, I'm going to try to record this at a couple of different levels of technicality for folks who are in the normal world and not totally stocked down the rabbit hole of AI. What you have to say is a really wonderful rabbit hole to be, to be done. It's a really interesting area and speech and voice attack is the aspect of it that I find actually most, I'm not sure I would say the most interesting because there's just so much that is fascinating in AI. But the most that I find the most personally transformative in terms of the impact that it's had on my daily work life and productivity and how I sort of work. And I'm persevering hard with the task of training, yes, a good solution working for Linux. Would you have anyone actually, does listen to this not just for the training data and for the actual content? This is this is sparked. I had, besides the fine tune not working. Well, that was the failure. I used Claude Codes because one thing's these days that there is nothing sort of solving you know, the reason of life or something at that's flawed and agentic AI can't do, which is not really the case. It does seem that way sometimes, but it fails a lot as well. And this is one of those instances where last week I put together an hour of voice training data. Basically speaking just random things for three minutes and it was actually kind of tedious because the texts were really weird. Some of them were it was like AI generated. I tried before to reach Sherlock Holmes for an hour and I just couldn't, I was so bored after 10 minutes that I was okay knowing just gonna have to find something out to read. So I used a created with AI Studio vibe code as a synthetic text generator, which actually I thought was probably a better way of doing it because it would give me more short samples with more varied content. So I was like okay, give me a voice note like I'm recording an email, give me a short story to read, give me pros to read. So I came up with all these different things and they added a little timer to it so I could see how to let us say well as to one hour. And I spent like an hour, one afternoon or probably two hours by the time you do retakes on whatever because you want to, it gave me a source of truth which I'm not sure if that's the scientific way to approach this topic of gathering training data, but I thought made sense. I have a lot of audio data from recording voice notes which I've also kind of used being experimenting with using for a different purpose. It's slightly different annotating task types. It's more text classification experiment or well it's more than that actually I'm working on a voice app so it's a prototype I guess is really more accurate. But you can do that and you can work backwards. You listen back to a voice note and you painfully go through one of those transcribing where you start and stop and scrub around in a new fixie areas but it's really really pouring to do that. So I thought it would be less tedious in the long term if I just recorded this source of truth. So it gave me these three minutes snippets. I recorded them it saved an MP3 and a TXT in the same folder and I created an error that data. So I was very hopeful that I could actually find you in whisper. I want to find you in whisper because when I got into voice tech last November my wife was in the US and I was alone at home and when crazy people like me do really wild things like use voice tech technology that was basically when I started doing it I didn't feel like a crazy person speaking to myself and my expectations weren't that high. I used speech tech now and again tried to write as like it would be really cool if you just like speak into your computer and whatever I tried I used that had Linux support was just it was not good basically and this blew me away from the first go. I mean it wasn't 100% accurate either the box and it took work but it was good enough that there was a solid foundation and it kind of passed that pivot point that it's actually worth doing this. There's a point where it's so like the transcript is you don't have to get 100% accuracy for it to be worth your time for it's speech tech to be worth while it isn't your productivity but you do need to get above let's say 85%. If it's 60% or 50% you inevitably say screw it I'll just type it because you end up missing errors in the transcript and it becomes actually worse you end up in a worse position than you started with that's been my experience. So I was like oh this is actually really really good now how did that happen? The answer is ASR whisper being open sourced and the transformer architecture if you want to go back to the to the underpinnings which really blows my mind and it's on my list to reto that paper all you need is attention as attentively as can be done with my limited brain because it's super super high level stuff super advanced stuff I mean but that I think of all the things that are fascinating about the sudden rise and AI and the dramatic capabilities I find fascinating a few people are like hang on you've got this thing that can speak to you like a chatbot and LLM and then you've got image generation okay so first of all those two things on the surface have nothing in common so like how did that just happen all at the same time and then when you extend that further you're like Suno right you can sing a song an AI will like come up with an instrumental and then you've got whisper and you're like wait a second how did all this stuff like if it's all AI what's like there has to be some commonality otherwise these are for these are totally different technologies on the surface of it and the transformer architecture is as far as I know the answer and I can't even say you can't even pretend that I really understand what the transformer architecture means in depth but I have scandice and as I said once a printed I'm really kind of think over it's at some point and I'll probably feel bad about myself I think because when those guys in the in their 20s like that's crazy I think I asked you to be one who were the who wrote that paper and how old were they when it was published in arcs of I was expecting like I don't know what do you imagine I personally imagine kind of like you know you have these breakthroughs during Covid and things like that were like these kind of really obscure scientists who are like in their 50s and they've just kind of been laboring labs and we're really in writing and publishing and kind of obscure academic publications and they finally like hit a bake or when a noble apprise and then their household names so that was kind of what I had that was the mental image I'd formed of the birth of arcs of like I wasn't expecting 20 somethings in San Francisco though I thought that was both very very funny very cool and actually kind of inspiring it's nice to think that people who you know just you might put them in the kind of milieu or bubble or world that you are in or incredibly in through you know the series of connections that are coming up with such literally world changing innovations so that was I thought anyway that that that was cool okay voice training data how are we doing we're at by 10 minutes and I'm still talking about voice technology so whisper was brilliant and I was so excited that I was my first instinct was to like guess like oh my gosh I have to get like a really good microphone for this so I didn't go on a spending spree because I said I'm gonna have to just wait a month and see if I still use this and it just kind of became it's become really part of my daily routine like if I'm writing an email I'll record a voice note and then I've developed and it's nice to see that everyone is like developing the same things in parallel like that's my kind of a weird thing to say but when I look I kind of came when I started working on this these prototypes on GitHub which is where I just kind of share very freely and loosely ideas and you know first iterations on concepts and for one of a better word I called it like LLM post processing or cleanup or basically a system prompt that after you get back the raw text from whisper you run it through model and say okay this is crappy text like add sentence structure and you know fix it up and now when I'm exploring the different tools that are out there the people of built I see quite a number of projects have basically you know done the same thing last that we missed construit I'm not saying for a millisecond that I inspired them I'm sure this has been a thing that's been integrated into tools for a while but it's it's the kind of thing that when you start using these tools every day the need for it is almost instantly apparent because text that doesn't have any punctuation or paragraph spacing takes a long time to you know it takes so long to get it into a presentable email that again it's it moves speech tech into that before that inflection point we're like that's just not worth it it's like it's just be quicker to type this so it's it's a big it's a little touch that actually is a big deal so I was on whisper and I've been using whisper and I kind of early on find a couple of tools I couldn't find what I was looking for on Linux which is basically just something that'll run in the background you'll give it an API key and it'll just like transcribe with like a little key to start and start the dictation and the issues where I discovered that like most people involved in creating these projects were very much focused on local models running whisper locally because you can and I tried that a bunch of times and just never got results that were as good as the cloud and when I began looking at the cost of the speech tech to API is what I was spending I just thought there is it's actually in my opinion just one of the better deals in API spending and in cloud like it's just not that expensive for very very good models that are much more you know you're going to be able to run the full model the latest model versus whatever you can run on your average GPU unless you want to buy crazy GPU it doesn't really make sense to me and I've been a lot of things that I know is kind of like a very much just everything the people just don't want their voice data and their voice leaving their local environment maybe for regular few reasons as well but I'm not in that I'm neither really care about people listening to my gross readest consisting of reminding myself that I need to buy more beer cheetos and hummus which is kind of the three three staples of my diet during periods of poor nutrition but the kind of stuff that I transcribe it's just not it's not a it's not a privacy thing that sort of sensitive about and I don't do anything so you know sensitive or secure that requires air capping so I looked at the pricing and especially the kind of older model mini some of them were very very affordable and I did it back the I did a calculation once with chatchewet and I was like okay this is the API price for I can't remember whatever the model was let's say I just go out at like nonstop which really happens probably I would say an average I might dictate 30 to 60 minutes per day if I was probably summing up the emails documents outlines which is a lot but it's still a fairly modest amount and I was like well some days I do go on like one or two days right being usually when I'm like kind of I'd do the house and just have something like I've nothing else to do like if I met a hospital we've a newborn and you're waiting for like eight hours and hours for an appointment and I would probably have listened to podcasts before becoming a speech fanatic and I'm like oh wait let me just get down let me just get these ideas out of my head and that's when I'll go on my speech spinches but those were like once every few months like not frequently but I said okay let's just say if I'm going to price out cloud STT if I was like dedicated every second of every waking hour to transcribing for some odd reason I mean it have to like ease and use the toilet like you know there's only so many hours I'm awake for so like let's just say a maximum of like 40 hour 45 minutes in the hour then I said all right let's just say 50 who knows you're dictating on the toilet we do it so you could just do 60 but whatever I did and every day like you're going flat out seven days a week dictating nonstop it's like what's my monthly API bill gonna be at this price and it came out to like 70 or 80 bucks and I was like well that would be an extraordinary amount of dictation and I would hope that there were some compelling reason more worth more than 70 dollars that I embarked upon their project so given the dots kind of the max point for me I said that's actually very very affordable now you're gonna if you want to specide the costs and you want to do the post processing that I really do feel as valuable that's gonna cost them more as well on the last you're using Gemini which needless to say is a random person sitting in Jerusalem I have no affiliation nor with Google nor anthropic nor Gemini nor any major tech vendor for that matter I like Gemini not so much as a everyday model it's kind of underwhelmed in that respect I would say but for multi-model I think it's got a lot to offer and I think that the transcribing functionality whereby it can process audio with the system prompt and both give you transcription that's cleaned up that reduces two steps to one and that for me is a very very big deal and I feel like even Google hasn't really sort of thought through how useful the downloadability is more kind of use cases you can achieve with it because I found in the course of this year just an endless list of really kind of system prompt system prompt stuff that I can say okay I've used the trick capture context data for AI which is literally I might speak for if I wanted to have a good bank of context data about who knows my childhood more realistically maybe my career goals something that would just be like really boring to type out so I'll just like sit in my car and record it for 10 minutes and that's 10 minutes you get a lot of information in emails which is short text just there is a whole bunch and all these workflows kind of require a little bit of treatment afterwards and different treatment my context pipeline is kind of like just to extract the bare essential so you end up with me talking very loosely about sort of what I've done in my career where I've worked where my light work and it goes it condenses that down to very robotic language that is easy to chunk parse and maybe put into a vector database Daniel has worked in technology Daniel is a has been working in Martin you know stuff like that that's not how you would speak but I figure it's probably easier to parse for after all robots so we've almost got to 20 minutes and this is actually a success because I waste 20 minutes of my of the evening speaking into my headphone and the levels were a shot and it was clipping and I said I can't read each and evaluation I have to be fair I have to give the models a chance to do their thing at what am I hoping to achieve in this okay my function was a daughter's mentioned Deep Gram STT I'm really really hopeful that this prototype will work and it's a build and public open source so anyone is welcome to use it if I make anything good but that was really exciting for me last night when after hours of trying my own prototype seeing someone just made something that works like that you know you're not going to have to build a custom condo environment and image I have AMD GPU which makes things much more complicated I didn't find it and I was about to give up and I said all right let me just give deep grams Linux thing a shot and if this doesn't work I'm just going to go back to trying to vibe code something myself and when I ran the script I was using cloud code to do the installation process it ran the script and oh my gosh it works just like that the tricky thing for all those who wants to know all the nitty ditty degree nitty gritty details was that I don't think it was actually struggling with transcription but pasting wailant makes life very hard and I think there was something not running in the right time anyway Deep Gram I looked at how they actually handled that because it worked out of the box one other stuff didn't and it was quite a clever little mechanism and but more and so it's not the accuracy was brilliant now what am I doing here this is going to be a 20 minutes audio sample and I'm I think I've done one or two of these before but I did this with sure snappy voice notes this is kind of long form it's actually might be a better approximation for what's useful to me than voice mammals like I need to buy three beaters of moke tomorrow and Peter bread which is probably how like half my voice note send like if anyone were to I don't know like find my phone they be like this is the most boring person in the world although actually there are some like kind of journaling thoughts as well but it's a lot of content like that and the probably for the evaluation the most useful thing is slightly obscure tech get hub the clean hooking face not so obscure that is not going to have a chance of knowing it but hopefully sufficiently well known that the models should get us I tried to do a little bit of speaking really fast and speaking very slowly I would say in general I've spoken delivered this at a faster pace than I usually would owe into strong coffee if flowing through my bloodstream and the thing that I'm not going to get into spent work is background noise which in my first take that I had to get rid of my wife come in with my son and for a good night kiss and that actually would have been super helpful to get in because it was non-diorized or if we had diorization a female I could say I want the male voice and that wasn't intended for transcription and I'm not going to get background noise like people honking their horns which is something of done to my main data set where I am trying to go back to some of my voice notes and I take them and run a benchmark but this is going to be just a pure quick test and someone working on a voice note idea that's my sort of end motivation besides thinking it's an astudiate standing technology that's coming to viability and really I know the same it's cheesy can actually have a very transformative effect it's you know voice technology has been life changing for folks living with disabilities and I think there's something really nice about the fact that it can also benefit you know folks who are able bodies and like we can all in different ways 

make this tech as useful as possible regardless of the exact way that we're using it and I think there's something very powerful in that and it can be very cool I see huge potential what excites me about voice tech a lot of things actually firstly the fact that it's cheap and accurate as I mentioned at the very start of this and it's getting better and better with stuff like accent handling I'm not sure my fine tune will actually ever come to fruition in the sense that I'll use it day to day as I imagine and get likes you per flawless words error rates because I'm just kind of skeptical about local speech attacks as I mentioned and I think the pace of innovation and improvement in the models the main reason for fine tuning from what I've seen have been people who are something that really blows my mind about ASR is the idea that it's inherently alien fuel or multilingual fanatic based so as folks who use speak very obsturately languages that there might be a policy of training data or almost none at all and therefore the accuracy is significantly reduced or folks in very critical environments I know they're you this is using extensively in medical transcription and dispatcher work as you know the call centers use send out ambulances etc where accuracy is absolutely paramount and in the case of doctors radiologists there might be using very specialized vocab all the time so those are kind of the main two things and I'm not sure that really just for training make it better on a few random tech words with my slightly I mean I have an accent but like not you know an accent that a few other million people have ish I'm not sure that my little fine tune is going to actually like the bump in word error reduction if I ever actually figure out how to do it and get it up to the by the time I've done that I suspect that the next generation of ASR will just be so good that it will kind of be no well that would be cool for a doubt but all this uses instead so that's going to be is for today's episodes of voice training data single long-shaw evaluation who am I going to compare with supposed to be a benchmark but I'm more interested in seeing whisper head to head with two things ready one is whisper variants so you've got these projects like faster whisper distilled whisper it's a bit confusing there's a whole bunch of them and the emerging ASR is which are also a thing my intention for this is I'm not sure I'm going to have the time in any point of the foreseeable future to go back to this whole episode and create a proper source true through a fix everything might do it if I can get one transcriptions as efficiently close to perfection but what I would actually love to do on hugging face I think would be a great probably how I might visualize this is having the audio waveform play and then have the transcript for each model below it and maybe even a like you know two scale and maybe even a local one as well like local whisper versus open AI API etc and I can then actually listen back to segments or anyone who wants to can listen back to segments of this recording and see where a particular model struggled and others didn't as well as the sort of headline finding of which had the best WER but that would require the source of truth okay that's it I hope this was I don't know maybe useful for other folks interested in STT you want to see that I always feel think I've just said something I didn't and do STT I said for those it's in carefully including hopefully the models themselves this has been myself Daniel Rosal for more jumbled repository is about my roving interest in AI but particularly agentic mcp and voice tech you can find me on get up hugging face where else Daniel Rosal.com which is my personal website as well as this podcast whose name I sadly cannot remember but the next time thanks for listening
